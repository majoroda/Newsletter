    <p>Name: Daniel Daniel Udo-akang</p>
    <h3>Introduction :</h3>
    <p>My site tells stories in different categories which includes recent sport , technology and entertainment news</p>
    <span>And I implemented the grid structure system when developing the site</span>
    <h3>Inspiration :</h3>
    <span>My inspiration came from different sources; </span>
    <ol>
        <li>the site structure was inspired by news website e.g bbc.com</li>
        <li>the use of color was from various sport news websites e.g skysports.com</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Accessibility :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> The site is operable in the sence that the web contents is keyboard accessible.</li>
        <li> It is understandable , the words and options are clear with no complex sentences for users with cognitive diability.</li>
        <li> It is robust , the texts and write ups can be easily read with ease by users with visual impairment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Learning :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, I visited different websites to get an idea on how the structure of the site should look like and what colors are mostly used.</li>
        <li>I reference w3schools frequently to grasp the idea of using a grid structure system</li>
        <li>Lastly, was implementing dynamic and also hover effects with vanilla javascript and css respectively</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Evaluation I :</h3>
    <p>I think the implementation of the grid structure system of the webpages was succesful <br>
       because it was easier to make the site responsive on every screen size
    </p>

    <h3>Evaluation II :</h3>
    <p>Personally, with time I should be able to improve in adding dynamic effects on multiple pages with ease</p>

    <h3>Resources :</h3>
    <p>I have implemented a few tools and libraries which includes;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>fontawesome.com</li>
        <li>favicon.ico</li>
        <li>Google fonts</li>
        <li>I also got information that was inputed as headlines and articles from websites e.g skysports.com , CNET.com and WWD news.</li>
    </ol>
